Brian will be turned off at some point in the next couple of days (probably wed arvo AU time). This means you will have a brief time to download songs before Brian is turned off completely.
Probably don't download your songs super soon after seeing this message... If everyone tries to at once, I fear Brian may come to a swifter end than origionally anticipated. ðŸ˜…

Brian is open source, but the code is quite difficult to get running, and pretty poor, so I wouldn't bother.

for futher inquires please message me (if you send a request to the bot after you message me I WON'T see your message).""",
