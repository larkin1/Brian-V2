# BRIAN Version 2 is here!
(and this time on github hehe)

## What is Brian?
Brian is a lil chatbot for whatsapp that i created to learn how to code... this is the second iteration of that, with better structure to the code and an easier way of doing things. 

## What can Brian do?
Not much at the moment, currently brian is just a shell waiting to be filled with commands.

## To-do:
### Features:
 - Song Downloader
 - Album Downloader
 - AI song Generator
 - AI image generator
 - ChatGPT chat (BrAIn)
### General:
 - Back-and-forth chatting. (eg the bot asks "are you sure you want to procede?")
 - Make my own whatsapp api so i can actually have control over it
 - Get a virtual phone number so it doesnt run on my personal number
 - Put it on a web server
 - Subscription tiers
